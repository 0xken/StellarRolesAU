2. Find the folder of your game. You can right click on the game in your library, a menu will appear, click on properties, local data, browse
3. Go back one folder to common and make a copy of your Among Us game folder and paste it somewhere on the same drive.
4. Now unzip and drag or extract the files from the .zip into your Among Us game folder that you just copied, at the `.exe` level (just into the folder).
5. Run the game by starting the .exe from this folder (the first launch might take a while).

Not working? You might want to install the dependency [vc_redist](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)

## Windows Installation Epic
1. Download the newest [release](https://github.com/Mr-Fluuff/StellarRolesAU/releases/latest)

![Install](https://i.imgur.com/pvBAyZN.png)

## Linux Installation
1. Install Among Us via Steam
2. Download newest [release](https://github.com/Mr-Fluuff/StellarRolesAU/releases/latest) and extract it to ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Among Us
3. Enable `winhttp.dll` via the proton winecfg (https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/steam_interop.html#open-winecfg-for-the-target-game)
4. Launch the game via Steam

## Custom Servers
**A custom server is not necessary and official servers are working just fine with the mod, but in case you want to set up and host your own server, here's a guide for you to follow.**

**Setup the Server:**
1. Get the Impostor release (https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor)
2. Follow the steps (using the server release you just downloaded) on the official Impostor-Documentation (https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor/wiki/Running-the-server)
3. Make sure to set the following values to false in the config.json file:
```    ...
     'AntiCheat': {
       'Enabled': false,
      'BanIpFromGame': false
    }
```
4. Make sure to forward the right ports on the hosting machine.
5. Run the server and setup the client.
Setting up Server as Docker Container:
If you want to run the server as a docker container you'll need to use the image
aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

(Currently only the 'nightly' tag is starting a server supporting 2021.3.31 or later)
In addition to running it we need to set the environment variables to disable the AntiCheat feature.
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false

Example to docker run command:
docker run -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

Or use to run it in the background
docker run -d -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

# Settings
The mod adds a few new settings to Among Us (in addition to the role settings):

### Task Count Limits per map
You can configure:
- Up to 4 common tasks
- Up to 23 short tasks
- Up to 15 long tasks

Please note, that if the configured option exceeds the available number of tasks of a map, the tasks will be limited to that number of tasks. \
Example: If you configure 4 common tasks on Airship crewmates will only receive 2 common tasks, as airship doesn't offer more than 2 common tasks.

| Map | Common Tasks | Short Tasks | Long Tasks |
|----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Skeld / Dleks | 2 | 19 | 8
| Mira HQ | 2 | 13 | 11
| Polus | 4 | 14 | 15
| Airship | 2 | 23 | 15

# Custom Hats
## Create and submit new hat designs
We're awaiting your creative hat designs and we'll integrate all the good ones in our mod.
Here are a few instructions, on how to create a custom hat:

- **Creation:** A hat consists of up to three textures. The aspect ratio of the textures has to be `4:5`, we recommend `300px:375px`:
  - `Main texture (required)`:
    - This is the main texture of your hat. It will usually be rendered in front of the player, if you set the `behind` parameter it will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern *hatname.png*, but you can also set some additional parameters in the file name by adding `_parametername` to the file name (before the *.png*).
    - Parameter `bounce`: This parameter determines whether the hat will bounce while you're walking or not.
    - Parameter `adaptive`: If this parameter is set, the Among Us coloring shader will be applied (the shader that replaces some colors with the colors that your character is wearing in the game). The color red (#ff0000) will be replaced with the primary color of your player and the color blue (#0000ff) with the secondary color. Also other colors will be affected and changed, you can have a look at the texture of the [Crewmate Hat](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/among-us-wiki/images/e/e0/Crewmate_hat.png) to see how this feature should be used.
    - Parameter `behind`: If this parameter is set, the main texture will be rendered behind the player.
  - `Flipped texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Main texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_flip.png`.
  - `Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back.png`.
  - `Flipped Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Back texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back_flip.png`.
  - `Climb texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered in front of the player, when they're climbing.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_climb.png`.
- **Testing:** You can test your hat design by putting all the files in the `\TheOtherHats\Test` subfolder of your mod folder. Then whenever you start a Freeplay game, you and all the dummies will be wearing the new hat. You don't need to restart Among Us if you change the hat files, just exit and reenter the Freeplay mode.

- **Submission:** If you got a hat design, you can submit it on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tKNVCXsP). We'll look at all the hats and add all the good ones to the game.

# Roles

## Role Assignment

First you need to choose how many special roles of each kind (Impostor/Neutral/Crewmate) you want in the game.
The count you set will only be reached, if there are enough Crewmates/Impostors in the game and if enough roles are set to be in the game (i.e. they are set to > 0%). The roles are then being distributed as follows:
- First all roles that are set to 100% are being assigned to arbitrary players.
- After that each role that has 10%-90% selected adds 1-9 tickets to a ticket pool (there exists a ticket pool for Crewmates, Neutrals and Impostors). Then the roles will be selected randomly from the pools as long it's possible (until the selected number is reached, until there are no more Crewmates/Impostors or until there are no more tickets). If a role is selected from the pool, obviously all the tickets of that role are being removed.

**Example:**\
Settings: 2 special Crewmate roles, Tracker: 100%, Watcher: 10%, Detective: 30%\
Result: Tracker is assigned, then one role out of the pool [Watcher, Detective, Detective, Detective] is being selected\
Note: Changing the settings to Watcher: 20%, Detective: 60% would statistically result in the same outcome .

## Changeling
### **Team: Imposters**
The Changeling is a 'choose your fighter'-style impostor role who behaves exactly like a vanilla impostor until they use their one-time use ability.\
\
**NOTE:**
- This ability will open up a menu with a list of all impostor roles with >0% spawn rate, excluding cultist and the role of their impostor partner(s). This menu will also respect roles that are exclusive of each other; for example: if the partner is a warlock, then both warlock and vampire will not be on the list. Selecting the role will permanently change the player into it. This can only be done once, and cannot be undone.
- The host can decide the power level of the Changeling through its ability to vent or increasing its kill cooldown before it changes.
- Ability cooldowns are set to 50% of their base cooldown upon changing.
- The kill cooldown will continue to count as normal upon changing.
- The Changeling can be guessed, but must be guessed as the proper role after they change.
- To prevent discouragement from late-game picks for roles that place objects: For every dead player in the game, miner vents and trickster boxes cooldowns are reduced by 15% (If this number is >=100%, objects will not have a cooldown). This effect is static at the time the changeling changes, meaning cooldowns are not reduced further after they change into the role.

## Vengeful-Romantic
### **Team: Neutral**
The Vengeful Romantic was once a romantic to a crewmate. Now that their love has died they must take their revenge! Their protect button now becomes an avenge button. Be careful tho as it will only work on the one who took your love away from you.

-The Vengeful Romantic CAN be assassinated
-The Vengeful Romantic's 'Shield' button is replaced with a 'Kill' button.
-This kill button behaves exactly like a sheriff's kill button but instead of misfiring on crewmates, this kill will misfire on everyone but the person who killed or assassinated your love. It starts on cooldown, matching base impostor cooldown.

## Ruthless-Romantic
### **Team: Neutral Killer**
The Ruthless Romantic is a neutral killing role that was once the romantic of another neutral killer.
Their objective now is to kill all crew and be the last killer standing.

## Head-Hunter
### **Team: Neutral Killer**
The headhunter is a neutral killing role who has three assigned kill targets every round.
These names are displayed to the headhunter in an alternate color during rounds and meetings.\
\
**Notes**
- The headhunter cannot target impostors or players who were dead first round of the previous game as its first three targets.
- The headhunter can never target more than one impostor at one time, and cannot target a solo impostor unless there are not enough players remaining or the impostor was already a target.
- If any of the headhunter's targets are killed, the headhunter will get new targets at the start of the next meeting.
- The headhunter has impostor vision and can vent. The Headhunter starts the game with a kill cooldown 5s higher than impostors.
- Every time the Headhunter kills a target, its kill cooldown is reduced by 5s. This effect is permanent.
- Every time the Headhunter kills a non-target, its kill cooldown is increased by 10s. This effect is permanent.
- The headhunter has a "Pursue" button to get arrows pointing to their targets for a set duration. This arrow will point to the targets death location in the event a target has been killed.

## Parity-Cop
### **Team: Crewmates**
**WARNING: This role is one of the most complex roles in the mod, and should only be used in advanced lobbies!**
The Parity Cop is a role that can select two players during rounds. In meetings these players will be compared to one another, to see if they have the same alignment or not! Players who are killed will not be compared. The two most recently selected living players will be compared during the next meeting. The Parity Cop may use this button as much as they want per round.\
\
**Notes**
- There are two categories that all players fit into: Crewmates, and Non-Crewmates.
- In meeting, players with matching alignments will be displayed with checkmarks!
- Mismatched players will be displayed with X's. Dead players may also see these comparisons! If the Parity Cop is killed, their final comparison will still be made! 
- When any Non-Crewmate role is put in a comparison with another player, they will be made aware of it in meeting with a ? next to their name, and next to the name of the person they were compared to. Crewmate roles do not see these indicators! 
- The host may decide to increase the difficulty of this role. There are two settings to place Neutral-Evil roles in the Crewmate category, or Crewmate-Killing roles(Sheriff and Vigilante) in the Non-Crewmate category! This setting is generally used for more advanced lobbies, or as a power-check to this strong role!
- The host may also enable an ability called Fake Out, though this is also recommended for advanced lobbies. Fake out will force the Parity Cop to the top of their running comparison list. If the most recent person they have compared is a Non-Crewmate, they will see a standard comparison has been made to them with the parity cop!
- Fake Out provides no information to the Parity Cop. It is simply a way for the Parity Cop to keep their role from being singled out, as they cannot compare themselves normally.

## Administrator
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Administrator is another simple role with one power: It can access the Admin Table from anywhere on the map! 
Like the Medic and the Watcher, the Administrator uses a Task-Powered-Battery to power its mobile Admin Table! The Task Battery gains a host-configured amount of charge whenever the Administrator does tasks! It costs 1 second of charge to open your admin table, and the power of the battery drains over time while it is open.\
\
**Notes**
- When you complete your tasks, the charge of the battery generates on its own! The host can configure an internal cooldown for this charge increase, though the default cooldown is 20 seconds.
- The host may choose to disable battery charging and access to your mobile power in the first round of the game. This should not discourage you from doing tasks on round one, as when you finish tasks the battery will charge on its own anyway.

## Watcher
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Watcher is a role with two abilities: Sensors and map-wide camera access!
Sensors have configurable charges. These charges are refreshed every round. Placed sensors are also cleared every round.
When the watcher places a sensor on the ground, the next player to stand next to it will alert the Watcher with a flash and an arrow pointing to which sensor was tripped. The arrow is the color of the player who tripped it by default, but the host can make this color anonymous.\
\
**Notes**
- Like the Medic and the Administrator, the Watcher uses a Task-Powered-Battery to power its mobile cameras! The Task Battery gains a host-configured amount of charge whenever the Watcher does tasks! It costs 1 second of charge to open your cameras, and the power of the battery drains over time while it is open.
- When you complete your tasks, the charge of the battery generates on its own! The host can configure an internal cooldown for this charge increase, though the default cooldown is 20 seconds.
- The host may choose to disable battery charging and access to your mobile power in the first round of the game. This should not discourage you from doing tasks on round one, as when you finish tasks the battery will charge on its own anyway.

## Trapper
### **Team: Crewmates**

The Trapper is a crewmate role that is centered around hindering the ability to use vents. It has two main abilities. Using one of these abilities will trigger the cooldown of the other. The first ability, Cover, is usable when the Trapper is near a vent. This will cover the vent after the next meeting. The second ability, Trap, is also usable when near a vent. This ability will trap the vent, rooting players who attempt to use it in place for a SHORT duration(intended to be ~3 seconds). When triggered, the trap is consumed and the trapper is notified with a flash. Traps are only visible to players who have been in close proximity to them for 3 seconds. Traps and Covers are NOT visible in fog of war. The trapper is aware of when a player is in a specific vent system with a red highlight(this includes the engineer/jester).\
\
**Abilities**
- Trap Vents - Roots people who use a trapped vent and notify the trapper. Traps are consumed when triggered. Traps are permanently visible after 3s of proximity. Placing a Trap triggers Cover cooldown. Traps are active as soon as they are placed. Rooted players are unable to move or take actions.
- Cover Vents - Permanently seals a vent. Placing a Cover triggers Trap cooldown. Covers are not visible in fog of war. Covers activate after the next meeting.

## Detective
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Detective is a crewmate role who gathers information from corpses and 'Crime Scenes'\
\
A crime scene is only visible to the detective, and is depicted by a blood stain, shown where they were killed.
Crime Scenes are visible the round after a player has been killed.
If a body is displaced, a crime scene will still only display where they died and not where they end up. A crime scene will NOT appear if a body has been cleaned.
The detective has a chat window during rounds where it notes information from inspections. The detective may also use this chat window to take personal notes.\
\
The Detective has one ability: Inspect
- This ability has no cooldown, but has a limit on how many times it can be used per body and per crime scene.
- Inspect has a duration, and is intended to be usable multiple times per object.
- Inspecting a corpse will give more valuable information than inspecting a body first, and is intended to have a higher limit to number of possible inspections.
- Inspect will cause a chat popup in the detective's chat window with a bit of information every time it is used. Order of information is given is random and cannot repeat.
 
**Information(In order of power):** 
     1. Body Age Before Round ends(Crime Scene) / Body Age Before Inspect(Corpse)
     2. Whether the player was killed by an ability or a kill button(sheriff misfire, vampire bite, warlock, etc count as abilities)
     3. Dead Player Role
     4. Name of another player this person has killed
     5. Number of Players this killer has killed(if <=2, skip this)

## Jailor
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Jailor is a crewmate-protective role with a meeting-based role-block ability. This role is meant to have a main focus on countering assassins. Their main ability {Jail} can be performed once per meeting, and is earned by completing tasks to build up charges(in a similar fashion to ToR's swapper). The Jailor can choose one person per meeting to jail. When jailed, a playerâs name is displayed in dark gray. Players who can see a Jailed Target are configurable. A jailed player is immune to all role-based interactions, and cannot perform role-based interactions themselves. Players who attempt any of these actions will have charges/shots consumed where it applies, and get a gray flash on their screen when they use their action on this player. If a player is jailed and for some reason tries to use a role ability in a meeting, the same thing happens to them. The only interaction a Jailed target can make without repercussion is an attempt to assassinate the jailor.
\
**Notes**
- If an incorrect assassinate attempt on the jailor is made when a target is jailed, their shot is consumed, they do not die, and a charge of their assassin shots are used up. They are not able to guess again in the same meeting.
- If an attempt is made to assassinate a Jailed target, the shot will fail without killing the assassin, regardless of it being correct or not. They may not make other guesses in that meeting.
- The Jailor is able to send in game messages to their jailed target, under a gray bean named âJailorâ
**Abilities:**
Jail: Choose a player in a meeting to be jailed. This player is now immune to all role-based interactions, and cannot perform role-based interactions. Only an assassin attempt can be made on the Jailor without repercussions.

Because of the vents the Engineer might not be able to start some tasks using the "Use" button, you can double-click on the tasks instead.
