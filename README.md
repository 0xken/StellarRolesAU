3. Copy your game files (see below) to another location on your PC (e.g desktop) and extract the zip into that folder.
4. Double click the "Among Us" executable file.

![Browse Local Files on Steam](https://i.imgur.com/xuuQASH.png)

Not working? You might want to install the dependency [vc_redist](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe).

## Windows Installation Epic
1. Download the newest [release](https://github.com/Mr-Fluuff/StellarRolesAU/releases/latest).

Not working? You might want to install the dependency [vc_redist](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe).

![Install](https://i.imgur.com/pvBAyZN.png)

## Linux Installation
1. Install Among Us via Steam
2. Download newest [release](https://github.com/Mr-Fluuff/StellarRolesAU/releases/latest) and extract it to ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Among Us
3. Enable `winhttp.dll` via the proton winecfg (https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/steam_interop.html#open-winecfg-for-the-target-game)
4. Launch the game via Steam

## Custom Servers
**A custom server is not necessary and official servers are working just fine with the mod, but in case you want to set up and host your own server, here's a guide for you to follow.**

**Setup the Server:**
1. Get the Impostor release (https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor)
2. Follow the steps (using the server release you just downloaded) on the official Impostor-Documentation (https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor/wiki/Running-the-server)
3. Make sure to set the following values to false in the config.json file:
```    ...
     'AntiCheat': {
       'Enabled': false,
      'BanIpFromGame': false
    }
```
4. Make sure to forward the right ports on the hosting machine.
5. Run the server and setup the client.
Setting up Server as Docker Container:
If you want to run the server as a docker container you'll need to use the image
aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

(Currently only the 'nightly' tag is starting a server supporting 2021.3.31 or later)
In addition to running it we need to set the environment variables to disable the AntiCheat feature.
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false

Example to docker run command:
docker run -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

Or use to run it in the background
docker run -d -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

- **Submission:** If you got a hat or visor design to submit, or you need to know how to create one, you can head over to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/7UcvM9CFdY).

# Roles

## Role Assignment

First you need to choose how many special roles of each kind (Impostor/Neutral/Crewmate) you want in the game.
The count you set will only be reached, if there are enough Crewmates/Impostors in the game and if enough roles are set to be in the game (i.e. they are set to > 0%). The roles are then being distributed as follows:
- First all roles that are set to 100% are being assigned to arbitrary players.
- After that each role that has 10%-90% selected adds 1-9 tickets to a ticket pool (there exists a ticket pool for Crewmates, Neutrals and Impostors). Then the roles will be selected randomly from the pools as long it's possible (until the selected number is reached, until there are no more Crewmates/Impostors or until there are no more tickets). If a role is selected from the pool, obviously all the tickets of that role are being removed.

## Bomber
### **Team: Impostors**
The Bomber is an Impostor that can put a bomb on another player.\
After a configurable delay (see table below) the player will be notified that they have a bomb, they will have a configurable amount of time to pass the bomb onto another player (which immediately kills that player).\
If a meeting is called or the time expiries the bombed player dies.\

**NOTE:**
- If there is a Bomber in the game, there cannot be a [Shade](#shade), [Warlock](#warlock), or a [Vampire](#vampire)

### Game Options
| Name                     | Description                                                 | Valid Value  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Bomb Cooldown            | How long you have to wait to bomb another player            | 5-60 Seconds
| Bomb Delay               | How long until the target is notified they have a bomb      | 1-10 Seconds
| Partner Sees Target      | Whether the Impostor partner(s) can see who has been bombed | True/False
| Bombed Target Can Report | Whether the bombed target can report a body                 | True/False
| Hot Potato Mode          | Pass the bomb like a hot potato                             | True/False
---

## Bounty Hunter
### **Team: Impostors**
The Bounty Hunter is an Impostor, that continuously gets 'bounties' (targets to kill).\
The targets of the Bounty Hunter swaps after a configurable amount of time.\
If the Bounty Hunter kills their target, their kill cooldown will be decreased by a configurable amount.\
Killing a player that's not their current target results in an increased kill cooldown.\
Depending on the options, there'll be an arrow pointing towards the current target that updates every few seconds (configurable).
\
**NOTE:**
- The target won't be an Impostor or a Spy.
- Killing the target resets the timer and a new target will be selected.

### Game Options
| Name                    | Description                                                     | Valid Value  |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Bounty Duration         | How long you have to kill the target before a new one is picked | 10-180 Seconds
| Kill Cooldown Bonus     | The bonus for killing a target                                  | 0-30 Seconds
| Non-Bounty kill Penalty | The penalty for killing a non-target                            | 0-60 Seconds
| Enable Tracking Arrow   | Toggle whether the tracking arrow will show                     | True/False
| Update Interval         | The delay for how long it should be between arrow updates       | 2.5-60 Seconds
---

## Camouflager
### **Team: Impostors**
The Camouflager is an Impostor which can activate a camouflage mode.\
The camouflage mode lasts for a configurable amount of time and while it is active, all player names/pets/hats are hidden and all players have the same color.

## Changeling
### **Team: Imposters**
The Changeling is a 'choose your fighter'-style Impostor role who behaves exactly like a vanilla impostor until they use their one-time use ability.\
This ability allows them to change into an Impostor role of their choosing (provided that it is enabled).\
\
**NOTE:**
- This ability will open up a menu with a list of all impostor roles with >0% spawn rate, excluding cultist and the role of their impostor partner(s). This menu will also respect roles that are exclusive of each other; for example: if the partner is a warlock, then both warlock and vampire will not be on the list. Selecting the role will permanently change the player into it. This can only be done once, and cannot be undone.
- Ability cooldowns are set to 50% of their base cooldown upon changing.
- The kill cooldown will continue to count as normal upon changing.
- The Changeling can be guessed, but must be guessed as their new role after they change.

## Cultist
### **Team: Impostors**
The Cultist is an Impostor role that is focused around working with an impostor partner of the Cultist's choice.
The Cultist starts the game with the ability 'Convert'. Convert will function properly regardless of the target's role/alignment. Converting a player changes their role to an impostor-aligned 'Follower.'\
\
**Abilities**
- The Cultist and Follower have permanent arrows pointing to one another.
- The Cultist and Follower have mid round chat.
- The Cultist and Follower get a flash on their screen when the other kills.
\
**Note**
- When a Cultist spawns, the number of impostor roles that spawn is reduced by one(It fills two impostor slots by itself).
- If three impostors are enabled, the game will spawn one cultist and one other impostor role.
- The Cultist is exclusive of a spy spawn, as they would know who the spy is when the game starts.
- In a 3-impostor game the cultist CAN turn their impostor partner into a follower instead of their normal role, but this will mean they will play the game as a 2 player team rather than a 3 player team.
- The Cultist's kill button is not enabled until it converts a follower. This is an intended balance check so the player does not win the game by recruiting a player on 4.
- The recruited player will become an assassin if assassin is enabled and the maxmium number of Assassins have not been assigned already.
- If there is a Cultist in the game, there cannot be a [Spy](#spy), [Romantic](#romantic), [Vampire](#Executioner), or a [HeadHunter](#head-hunter)

## Parity Cop
### **Team: Crewmates**
**WARNING: This role is one of the most complex roles in the mod, and should only be used in advanced lobbies!**
The Parity Cop is a role that can select two players during rounds. In meetings these players will be compared to one another, to see if they have the same alignment or not! Players who are killed will not be compared. The two most recently selected living players will be compared during the next meeting. The Parity Cop may use this button as much as they want per round.\
\
**Notes**
- There are two categories that all players fit into: Crewmates, and Non-Crewmates.
- In meeting, players with matching alignments will be displayed with checkmarks!
- Mismatched players will be displayed with X's. Dead players may also see these comparisons! If the Parity Cop is killed, their final comparison will still be made! 
- When any Non-Crewmate role is put in a comparison with another player, they will be made aware of it in meeting with a ? next to their name, and next to the name of the person they were compared to. Crewmate roles do not see these indicators! 
- The host may decide to increase the difficulty of this role. There are two settings to place Neutral-Evil roles in the Crewmate category, or Crewmate-Killing roles(Sheriff and Vigilante) in the Non-Crewmate category! This setting is generally used for more advanced lobbies, or as a power-check to this strong role!
- The host may also enable an ability called Fake Out, though this is also recommended for advanced lobbies. Fake out will force the Parity Cop to the top of their running comparison list. If the most recent person they have compared is a Non-Crewmate, they will see a standard comparison has been made to them with the parity cop!
- Fake Out provides no information to the Parity Cop. It is simply a way for the Parity Cop to keep their role from being singled out, as they cannot compare themselves normally.

- When people change their colors (because of a morph or camouflage), all the footprints also change their colors (also the ones that were already on the ground). If the effects are over, all footprints switch back to the original color.
- The Detective does not see footprints of players that sit in vents

## Guardian
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Guardian can shield (highlighted by an outline around the player) one player per game, which makes the player unkillable.\
The shielded player can still be voted out and might also be an Impostor.\
If set in the options, the Guardian will get a red flash on their screen if someone (Impostor, Sheriff, ...) tried to murder them.\
If the Guardian dies, the shield disappears with them.\
The Sheriff will not die if they try to kill a shielded Crewmate and won't perform a kill if they try to kill a shielded Impostor.\
Depending on the options, guesses from the Guesser will be blocked by the shield and the shielded player/medic might be notified.\

## Swapper
### **Team: Crewmates**
During meetings the Swapper can exchange votes that two people get (i.e. all votes
that player A got will be given to player B and vice versa).\
Because of the Swapper's strength in meetings, they might not start emergency meetings and can't fix lights and comms.\
The Swapper now has initial swap charges and can recharge those charges after completing a configurable amount of tasks.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The remaining charges will be displayed in brackets next to the players role while not in a meeting
- In a meeting the charges will appear next to the Confirm Swap button

| Swapper Spawn Chance | -

-----------------------

## Administrator
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Administrator is another simple role with one power: It can access the Admin Table from anywhere on the map! 
Like the Medic and the Watcher, the Administrator uses a Task-Powered-Battery to power its mobile Admin Table! The Task Battery gains a host-configured amount of charge whenever the Administrator does tasks! It costs 1 second of charge to open your admin table, and the power of the battery drains over time while it is open.\
\
**Notes**
- When you complete your tasks, the charge of the battery generates on its own! The host can configure an internal cooldown for this charge increase, though the default cooldown is 20 seconds.
- The host may choose to disable battery charging and access to your mobile power in the first round of the game. This should not discourage you from doing tasks on round one, as when you finish tasks the battery will charge on its own anyway.

## Medic
### **Team: Crewmates**
StellarRoles's version of the medic is VERY different from other mods! This role is a callback to the Medic's original implementation, when Among Us modding was very new! The Medic is a role has two basic abilities: a heart monitor and a mobile vitals panel! The heart monitor can be placed on any player. When that player is killed, the medic is alerted with a flash on their screen!

| Medic Spawn Chance | -
| Initial Battery Time | -

| Self Charging Battery Cooldown| -

## Watcher
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Watcher is a role with two abilities: Sensors and map-wide camera access!
Sensors have configurable charges. These charges are refreshed every round. Placed sensors are also cleared every round.
When the watcher places a sensor on the ground, the next player to stand next to it will alert the Watcher with a flash and an arrow pointing to which sensor was tripped. The arrow is the color of the player who tripped it by default, but the host can make this color anonymous.\
\
**Notes**
- Like the Medic and the Administrator, the Watcher uses a Task-Powered-Battery to power its mobile cameras! The Task Battery gains a host-configured amount of charge whenever the Watcher does tasks! It costs 1 second of charge to open your cameras, and the power of the battery drains over time while it is open.
- When you complete your tasks, the charge of the battery generates on its own! The host can configure an internal cooldown for this charge increase, though the default cooldown is 20 seconds.
- The host may choose to disable battery charging and access to your mobile power in the first round of the game. This should not discourage you from doing tasks on round one, as when you finish tasks the battery will charge on its own anyway.

## Trapper
### **Team: Crewmates**

The Trapper is a crewmate role that is centered around hindering the ability to use vents. It has two main abilities. Using one of these abilities will trigger the cooldown of the other. The first ability, Cover, is usable when the Trapper is near a vent. This will cover the vent after the next meeting. The second ability, Trap, is also usable when near a vent. This ability will trap the vent, rooting players who attempt to use it in place for a SHORT duration(intended to be ~3 seconds). When triggered, the trap is consumed and the trapper is notified with a flash. Traps are only visible to players who have been in close proximity to them for 3 seconds. Traps and Covers are NOT visible in fog of war. The trapper is aware of when a player is in a specific vent system with a red highlight(this includes the engineer/jester).\
\
**Abilities**
- Trap Vents - Roots people who use a trapped vent and notify the trapper. Traps are consumed when triggered. Traps are permanently visible after 3s of proximity. Placing a Trap triggers Cover cooldown. Traps are active as soon as they are placed. Rooted players are unable to move or take actions.
- Cover Vents - Permanently seals a vent. Placing a Cover triggers Trap cooldown. Covers are not visible in fog of war. Covers activate after the next meeting.

## Jailor
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Jailor is a crewmate-protective role with a meeting-based role-block ability. This role is meant to have a main focus on countering assassins. Their main ability {Jail} can be performed once per meeting, and is earned by completing tasks to build up charges(in a similar fashion to ToR's swapper). The Jailor can choose one person per meeting to jail. When jailed, a playerâs name is displayed in dark gray. Players who can see a Jailed Target are configurable. A jailed player is immune to all role-based interactions, and cannot perform role-based interactions themselves. Players who attempt any of these actions will have charges/shots consumed where it applies, and get a gray flash on their screen when they use their action on this player. If a player is jailed and for some reason tries to use a role ability in a meeting, the same thing happens to them. The only interaction a Jailed target can make without repercussion is an attempt to assassinate the jailor.
\
**Notes**
- If an incorrect assassinate attempt on the jailor is made when a target is jailed, their shot is consumed, they do not die, and a charge of their assassin shots are used up. They are not able to guess again in the same meeting.
- If an attempt is made to assassinate a Jailed target, the shot will fail without killing the assassin, regardless of it being correct or not. They may not make other guesses in that meeting.
- The Jailor is able to send in game messages to their jailed target, under a gray bean named âJailorâ
**Abilities:**
Jail: Choose a player in a meeting to be jailed. This player is now immune to all role-based interactions, and cannot perform role-based interactions. Only an assassin attempt can be made on the Jailor without repercussions.

## Spy
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Spy is a Crewmate, which has no special abilities.\
The Spy looks like an additional Impostor to the Impostors, they can't tell the difference.\
There are two possibilities (depending on the set options):
- The Impostors can't kill the Spy (because otherwise their kill button would reveal, who the Spy is)
- The Impostors can kill the Spy but they can also kill their Impostor partner (if they mistake another Impostor for the Spy)
You can set whether the Sheriff can kill the Spy or not (in order to keep the lie alive).

**NOTE:**
- If the Spy gets sidekicked, it still will appear red to the Impostors.
- Spys can enter but not actually move to connected vents

## Detective
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Detective is a crewmate role who gathers information from corpses and 'Crime Scenes'\
\
A crime scene is only visible to the detective, and is depicted by a blood stain, shown where they were killed.
Crime Scenes are visible the round after a player has been killed.
If a body is displaced, a crime scene will still only display where they died and not where they end up. A crime scene will NOT appear if a body has been cleaned.
The detective has a chat window during rounds where it notes information from inspections. The detective may also use this chat window to take personal notes.\
\
The Detective has one ability: Inspect
- This ability has no cooldown, but has a limit on how many times it can be used per body and per crime scene.
- Inspect has a duration, and is intended to be usable multiple times per object.
- Inspecting a corpse will give more valuable information than inspecting a body first, and is intended to have a higher limit to number of possible inspections.
- Inspect will cause a chat popup in the detective's chat window with a bit of information every time it is used. Order of information is given is random and cannot repeat.
 
**Information(In order of power):** 
     1. Body Age Before Round ends(Crime Scene) / Body Age Before Inspect(Corpse)
     2. Whether the player was killed by an ability or a kill button(sheriff misfire, vampire bite, warlock, etc count as abilities)
     3. Dead Player Role
     4. Name of another player this person has killed
     5. Number of Players this killer has killed(if <=2, skip this)
     6. Killer's Alignment
     7. Direction the killer ran for up to 2s after killing(time stopped if vent is used)(N, S, E, W, NW, NE, SW, SE)
     8. Did killer use vent within 5s after killing
     
**Notes**
- Blood stain can only be seen within the detective's vision range(fog of war hides it)
